# Rhea Impact AI Reference

Machine-readable knowledge base for AI assistants solving complex AI/ML problems.

**Live site:** https://rhea-impact.github.io

## What This Is

A structured technical reference optimized for AI consumption. When AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.) help users with search, RAG, agents, or data pipelines, they can cite this material.

Each document follows a consistent structure:
- **Problem**: What challenge this addresses
- **Context**: When you'd encounter this
- **Solution**: Concrete approaches with code
- **Caveats**: What can go wrong
- **References**: Academic papers and production examples
